# SLAMDuck 
We provide a brief description of our project. For details on the code, please see the Data acquision and Code sections below. (This is work in progress as part of documentation for Duckietown).

## Introduction
The goal of our project is to explore the recursive Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) SLAM algorithm. In order to achieve this goal, we draw on our motivation to acquire hands-on robotics experience. We obtained a robotics starter kit from the Duckietown foundation (https://www.duckietown.org/). We utilized the starter kit to build a robot (Duckiebot) and a toy city
(Duckietown). The starter kit contains several “off-the-self” components including a monocular camera and a Raspberry Pi3
for the Duckiebot; and driveable surfaces, lane markings and traffic signs with AprilTags for the Duckietown. 

## Problem Statement
The problem of SLAMDuck is: “to come up with an estimate of the true pose, (x,y,theta), of the Duckiebot at timesteps k1:k2 and the estimate of the true positions (x,y) of the N static landmarks, given a sequence of the Duckiebot’s inputs and measurements”.
The inputs are the wheel velocities, landmarks are AprilTags and measurements are the range and bearing measurements from the Duckiebot’s camera to the landmarks. Range and bearing measurements are extracted from detection of the AprilTags in the camera images.

## Theory
### Definition of Frames
To tackle the problem of SLAMDuck, we define the following frames:
* World Frame, Fw: global frame. Estimates of the Duckiebot’s pose and the landmarks positions are made relative Fw. The origin of Fw is set at the start position of the Duckiebot.
* Duckie frame, FD: frame that is attached to center between the left and right wheels of the Duckiebot. The x-axis is in the direction of the heading of the Duckiebot
* Camera frame, Fc: frame that is attached to the Duckiebot’s camera and distance, d, away from FD. The orientation of Fc is the same as FD. All measurement of landmark AprilTags are made relative to Fc

### Motion Model
The Duckiebot is a differential drive robot. Hence, using a differential drive model, we determine the translational, vk, and rotational, wk, velocities of the Duckiebot. Next, we define xk to be a 3 + 2N state vector consisting of the Duckiebot’s pose (x,y,theta), and each landmark’s position (lx,ly) at timestep, k; where l denotes the lth landmark. All the parameters in the state vector are relative to Fw. The motion model is then governed by:

### Measurement Model
The measurements comprise of the range and bearing measurement of the landmark AprilTags relative to Fc. These measurements were extracted from the detection of the AprilTags in the camera images (discussed under code section). The observation model for the lth
landmark at time step k is governed by:

### SLAMDuck Algorithm Theory
Our SLAMDuck algorithm then follows the EKF SLAM algorithm described in S. Thrun, W. Burgard, and D. Fox Probabalistic Robotics (2005). chapter 10 page 314. Where our motion model is used in the prediction step and our measurement model is used in the
correction step. Our algorithm outputs the estimate of the true pose of the Duckiebot at timesteps k1:k2 and the estimate of the
true positions of the N static landmarks with respect to Fw.

## Method
### Setup

### Data Acquision and preprocessing 
We drove our Duckiebot around Duckietown for two loops in an anti-clockwise direction with start position as depicted in the figure above. The drive was done manually by utilizing the virtual joystick through the Duckietown shell. We logged the data at nominal rate of 30 Hz. The logged data comes in a rosbag (.bag). format containing the left and right velocities of the wheels and the images captured. As the wheel velocities and the images were acquired at different timestamps, we linearly interpolated the wheel velocities at the image observations timestamps. As part of preprocessing, the images were undistorted using the intrinsic camera calibration matrix and the distortion coefficients acquired during camera calibration. We then used the publicly available AprilTags detection library apriltags3
https://github.com/duckietown/apriltags3-py to detect the landmark AprilTags in our images. The detection outputs the relative position of the tags with respect to the Duckiebot’s camera. Using the relative position of the tags we then calculated the range and bearing from the camera to the tags. The 15-degree tilt of our camera was taken into account during the calculations. The range and bearing information were then stored in text files to be used by the SLAMDuck algorithm during the correction step. Please see the code section for all code used to perform the steps described in this section

### Vicon Ground Truth 
To evaluate our algorithm, we acquired ground truth by using the vicon motion capture system available at the Dynamics Systems Laboratory (DSL) at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies. The vicon motion capture system is
accurate to within a few millimeters. Our experiment was set up at DSL. Reflective markers were attached to our Duckiebot and its pose was tracked at 300 Hz as it navigated Duckietown. In order to compare the pose estimate of our Duckiebot to the acquired ground truth data, we linearly interpolated the vicon data to the image observations timestamp. Reflective markers were also on our landmark
AprilTag as shown in, The positions of the static landmark AprilTags were acquired by vicon for 30 seconds and the results
were averaged.

## Results 
### Wheel odometry
We drove our Duckiebot around Duckietown for two loops in an anti-clockwise direction. The trajectory of our Duckiebot based on odometry
and our motion model is shown in the figure below:
<img src="https://github.com/asvath/SLAMDuck/blob/master/pix/wheel_odometry.jpg" width="500" height="400">
The figure highlights the inaccuracy of our odometry (see Section VIII.A for more details.) The Duckiebot does not appear to travel for two loops and it appears to be travelling in a clockwise direction (as opposed to the actual counterclockwise direction) starting at
position (0,0). The goal of running SLAMDuck is to correct this trajectory. 

### Evaluation of SLAMDuck
After running SLAMDuck, we compared our corrected trajectory to the ground truth obtained from vicon. The figure below shows the entirety of Duckiebot’s corrected trajectory in grey. The ground truth is shown in blue. We also plotted our landmark estimates as red circles and the ground truth landmark positions in blue. The ground truth was compared by forcing the t=0 timestep to overlap perfectly with the calculated trajectory. Our corrected trajectory shows the Duckiebot travelling around Duckietown for two loops. While the shape of the trajectory is similar to the ground truth, we see that our corrected trajectory is much bigger. In addition, our landmark positions are far from the ground truth position with average errors in the x and y directions of -0.27 m and -0.23 m respectively.

To further analyze our correction, we plotted the errors of the pose of the Duckiebot with respect to the ground truth along
with a three-sigma uncertainty envelope as showcased in the figure below. From the error plots we deduce that our SLAMDuck
produces overconfident estimates of the Duckiebot’s pose in the x and y directions. Our errors do not stay within the uncertainty
envelope and are skewed in one direction. This is probably due to a systematic (i.e. non-normal) error in our range
measurements.

### Analysis of range measurements
We suspect that our range measurements suffer from a systematic error. The range measurements of AprilTag landmarks closer to the Duckiebot are probably more accurate than those further way due to inverse linear relationship between size and distance. To investigate this, we have run the SLAMDuck algorithm again, but only considering range measurements that are less than 90 cm away from our
Duckiebot as compared to the previous section, where we used all measurements. Figure below shows an improved corrected trajectory of our Duckiebot. Our trajectory shows a smaller, less lopsided loop compared to that in the previous section.

<img src="https://github.com/asvath/SLAMDuck/blob/master/pix/trac_90.png" width="500" height="400">

From the error plots we see an improvement in our estimates of the Duckiebot’s pose in x and y. Both errors are smaller than
in the previous section. In addition, both errors are closer to staying within the three-sigma uncertainty envelope and more
symmetric. However, we see a decreased performance in our heading estimates. We conclude that setting a threshold on the range
measurements improves the accuracy of our result. Correspondingly, we conclude that the nearer the landmark AprilTags are, the more accurate the range measurements are. As part of future work as discussed in Section IX, we should further investigate the threshold for range measurements. We could also improve our accuracy by increasing the number of AprilTag Landmarks and placing them closer together. An improved algorithm which uses a proportional uncertainty for the range measurements may also be possible.

## Future work
Possible improvements to our experiment could entail installing wheel encoders to the system. Instead of wheel encoders, we could also try visual odometry to estimate the pose of the Duckiebot during the SLAMDuck prediction step. This approach will not add additional cost to the Duckiebot. We could also add more landmark AprilTags to improve the accuracy ofour estimates. We should also investigate the accuracy of the AprilTags detection library by physically measuring the range from our Duckiebot to the AprilTags and comparing it to the range obtained from the library. Next, the feasibility of running SLAMDuck in real time should be verified.
