# SLAMDuck : Introduction
The goal of our project is to explore the recursive Extended Kalman
Filter (EKF) SLAM algorithm. In order to achieve this goal, we draw on our motivation to acquire hands-on robotics experience.
We obtained a robotics starter kit from the Duckietown foundation (https://www.duckietown.org/). We utilized the starter kit to build a robot (Duckiebot) and a toy city
(Duckietown). The starter kit contains several “off-the-self” components including a monocular camera and a Raspberry Pi3
for the Duckiebot; and driveable surfaces, lane markings and traffic signs with AprilTags for the Duckietown.
